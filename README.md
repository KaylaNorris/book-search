# Book Search Engine

## Description
This application was refactored to use a GraphQL API build with Apollo Server. The original Good Books API search engine was built with a RESTful API. The existing middleware was also refactored to work with the GraphQL API. This application is deployed via Heroku [here](https://tranquil-peak-51227-88e0879a4887.herokuapp.com/)
